# webby — React + Vite starter

Welcome! This is a small React starter built with Vite so you can learn and experiment.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or newer) and npm installed.
- If you're under 13, ask a parent or guardian for help.

Quick start (copy these commands into a terminal)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Then open your browser at http://localhost:5173
```

Build for production
```bash
npm run build
# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

How to add these files to GitHub (quick)
- Option A (easiest): On GitHub, create a repository named `webby`, then use "Add file → Create new file" to create files and paste the contents above. For folders, create files like `src/App.jsx` and GitHub will make the folders.
- Option B (using git on your computer): create the files locally, then run:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial React + Vite starter"
git branch -M main
# create the repo on github.com first, then add the remote:
git remote add origin https://github.com/0dayz-stack/webby.git
git push -u origin main
```

Deploying to GitHub Pages (optional)
- The repo contains a GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish to the `gh-pages` branch automatically when you push to `main`. You can enable Pages in Settings to serve from `gh-pages` later.

Have fun learning! If you want extra features (routing, Tailwind, TypeScript, or a small Express API), tell me and I’ll add them.
